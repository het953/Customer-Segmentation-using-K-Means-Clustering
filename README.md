Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Overview: 
This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their buying behavior, which can help retailers to better understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is the "Customer Segmentation" dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Requirements: 
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

Output: 
The script will output the following:

A scatter plot showing the customer segments.
A table showing the mean values for each feature in each cluster.
A text file containing the cluster labels for each customer.

Example Use Cases: 
Retailers can use this algorithm to segment their customers based on their purchase history and develop targeted marketing strategies.
The algorithm can be used to identify loyal customers, frequent buyers, and customers who are likely to churn.
